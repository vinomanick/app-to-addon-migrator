An opinionated cli tool to migrate Ember components from app to addons within a Yarn workspace.

*NOTE:* This cli tool works only with the following conventional folder structure for your Ember app.

```
|-app
|-packages
| |-addons
| |-engines
| | |-dashboards-engine
| | |-tickets-engine

```

## Assumptions made by this tool
- Your Ember app lives in the root of your project folder.
- Engines live under `packages/engines` folder.
- Addons live under `packages/addons` folder.
- You are using [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).
- You are using [POD](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/project-layouts/#podslayout) structure for your components.

## Install
```
npm i -g app-to-addon-migrator
```

## Usage
```
atam [entity] [entity-name] [dest-folder]
atam route default packages/engines/dashboards-engine
```

After running the above command, the route `default` from `app/routes/default.js` will be
moved to `packages/engines/dashboards-engine/addon/routes/default.js`

### Dry-run
If you just want to see/verify the movement use the `--dry-run` or `-d` option.

```
atam route default packages/engines/dashboards-engine -d
```

This will print something like (without actually copying the files):
```
Moving route.js
---------------
app/routes/helpdesk/default.js
packages/engines/dashboards-engine/addon/routes/default.js


Moving route template.hbs
-------------------------
app/templates/helpdeskdefault.hbs
packages/engines/dashboards-engine/addon/templates/default.hbs

...
```
